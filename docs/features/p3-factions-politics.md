## Overview

The city has political factions — business interests, labor, residents, reformers — each with approval ratings influenced by the player's decisions. Factions affect city council votes on major projects, generate political events, and create governance tension. Later depth includes individual council members with personalities, elections influenced by demographics, and corruption mechanics.

Initially abstract (just approval numbers per faction), deepened over time through the event system and expansions.
