# River Transport & Water Features

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Terrain (Milestone 2, complete), Goods & Imports (p2-goods-imports)

## Overview

Rivers are economic arteries — they provide water power for mills, cheap freight transport, fertile floodplains for agriculture, and desirable waterfront land. Currently, water is just flat blue planes. This feature upgrades rivers into functional terrain features with economic implications: river crossings as founding opportunities, water-powered industry, river transport for goods, and flooding as a risk.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Generate rivers as terrain features that follow valleys from elevation to water level
- [ ] River crossings as founding location opportunities (ferry landing, bridge town)
- [ ] Rivers provide water power bonus for adjacent industries (mills)
- [ ] River transport as an alternative trade route (cheaper than road for bulk goods)
- [ ] Waterfront land has desirability bonus (attracts wealthier residents)
- [ ] Flooding risk for low-lying areas near rivers
- [ ] Bridge construction required to cross rivers (ties into existing bridge system)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Rivers are visible, flowing terrain features that follow natural topography
- Rivers create economic opportunities (mills, transport, fertile land) and risks (flooding)
- Waterfront areas develop differently than inland areas
