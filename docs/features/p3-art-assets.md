**Priority:** P3
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Building Spawning (p0-building-spawning), all core gameplay systems

## Overview

Replace placeholder boxes with 1920s Art Deco era-appropriate 3D models. This is what gives the game its visual identity and market differentiation — brick factories with smokestacks, ornate commercial facades, Craftsman-style houses, streetcars, period vehicles, and the distinctive geometric patterns of Art Deco architecture.

This is intentionally last-priority because the game needs to be fun with boxes first. Art is a polish layer on top of solid systems.
