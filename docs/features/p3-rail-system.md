# Rail System

**Priority:** P3
**Status:** Not Started
**Depends On:** Goods & Imports (p2-goods-imports), Founding System (p1-founding-system)

## Overview

Rail is the dominant freight and intercity transport of the 1920s. A rail connection fundamentally changes a town's economics — cheaper imports, higher-capacity trade, access to distant markets, and a different class of immigrant (train travel costs money, so rail connections bring wealthier/skilled arrivals).

Rail lines are pre-existing map features (not player-built, at least initially). The player's founding choice may involve proximity to rail. Later, the player might lobby for a rail spur or build a depot to connect to a nearby line.

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Add rail lines as pre-existing map features during terrain generation
- [ ] Rail depots as a founding establishment option
- [ ] Rail connection provides higher-capacity, cheaper import/export than roads
- [ ] Rail affects immigration (different demographic mix than road arrivals)
- [ ] Player can build rail depots to connect to nearby rail lines
- [ ] Freight logistics: goods arrive by rail at depots, then distribute via road network
- [ ] Future: passenger rail, streetcars, transit systems

## Acceptance Criteria

- Rail connections are visually present on the map
- Towns with rail access have meaningfully different economics than road-only towns
- Rail depots function as trade and immigration hubs
